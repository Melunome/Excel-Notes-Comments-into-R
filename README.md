# Excel-Notes-Comments-into-R
Troubleshoot Rscript 


# I am working with long-term cattle weight datasets.
# Over the history of this data management, technicians were recording specific steers notes, important to analyses, as a Note/Comment feature in Excel
# I do not want to have to copy/paste those manually across 80 years worth of data, so I would like to figure out how to read in an excel workbook and save
# the Excel Notes/Comments as a column feature in the R dataframe as I work forward with the analysis.
